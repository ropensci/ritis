An interface to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)

* ITIS API Docs: https://www.itis.gov/ws_description.html

How to cite ITIS. From https://itis.gov/citation.html 

To cite data obtained from ITIS, the following citation format is offered as a suggestion:

    Retrieved [month, day, year], from the Integrated Taxonomic Information System on-line database, http://www.itis.gov.


ITIS is one of many different taxonomic data sources. Other include: Catalogue of Life (and COL+), NCBI taxonomy, International Plant Names Index, Index Fungorum, and more. The Wikipedia entry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Taxonomic_Information_System) states that ITIS has a North American focus, but includes many taxa not in North America.

## Terminology

* "mononomial": a taxonomic name with one part, e.g, _Poa_
* "binomial": a taxonomic name with two parts, e.g, _Poa annua_
* "trinomial": a taxonomic name with three parts, e.g, _Poa annua annua_
